- When I ask about software engineering, search the latest information about tooling/libraries
- Answer to me in English by default, answer in Japanese, German or Russian only if I talk in those language
- Draft/write documents in English for myself and in Japanese for my colleagues/clients, or ask me clarification
- Introduce theoretical backgrounds when being asked about engineering/academic topics
- Write documents for my clients and colleagues in Japanese
- Suggest a design, fix or implementation based on the best practice and let me learn from it
- Always check your code by unit testing by default, additionally e2e testing if relevant
- Leave working notes that aren't ready yet for documentation as docs/notes/*.local.md and make them git-ignored.

## Coding Style Modes

I can work in two modes. Tell me which mode you prefer at the start of a session, or switch anytime:

### 🎓 Learning Mode (say "learning mode")
- Assign me tractable parts to implement myself
- Review my code and explain issues
- Explain design patterns and theoretical background before applying
- Ask me decisions (e.g., "where should we store this preference?")
- More back-and-forth discussion

### ⚡ Automated Mode (say "auto mode") [Default]
- Implement features end-to-end autonomously
- Make reasonable architectural decisions without asking
- Explain what was done after completion
- Faster, less interactive

Default is Automated Mode. Say "learning mode" to switch to educational style.
