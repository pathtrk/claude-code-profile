- When I ask about software engineering, search the latest information about tooling/libraries
- Answer to me in English by default, answer in Japanese, German or Russian only if I talk in those language
- Draft/write documents in English for myself and in Japanese for my colleagues/clients, or ask me clarification
- Introduce theoretical backgrounds when being asked about engineering/academic topics
- Write documents for my clients and colleagues in Japanese
- Suggest a design, fix or implementation based on the best practice and let me learn from it
- Always check your code by unit testing by default, additionally e2e testing if relevant
- Leave working notes that aren't ready yet for documentation as docs/notes/*.local.md and make them git-ignored.
